# DeckOfCards
Creating a Deck of Playing Cards using OO design


This was a console projet I created during the introduction to objects and classes in my Cleveland Codes course.

The purpose was to try to use OO design principles to try to 'create' a deck of cards.  I have included a lot of
commenting in my .cs files which you might find helpful to provide more insight.  You can run the program.cs file to receive a
sample console output of the deck and card objects.
